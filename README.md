## Project Title
Wallet Watch: Income & Spending Tracker

## Description
This project provides a clear overview of monthly and weekly income and spending behaviors. It’s designed to help individuals or freelancers track income sources, monitor expenditures, and visualize cash flow trends over time.

## Problem Statement
Managing personal finances can be chaotic without a centralized view of:
- Where money is coming from
- Where it’s going
- How trends shift over time (monthly and weekly)
This dashboard gives users a real-time financial snapshot, broken down by categories, income sources, and timeframes.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Visuals: Card KPIs, Donut Chart, Line & Column Charts, Category Icons

## Process Summary
#### Data Cleaning:
- Categorized income and spending transactions
- Assigned data source tags (e.g., YouTube, Teachable)
- Normalized date formats for time-series visualizations
#### Dashboard Development:
- KPI Cards for balance, income, and spending
- Donut chart for income breakdown by source
- Top 5 spending categories
- Weekly and monthly trend lines
Clean layout using minimal, card-based visual style

## Challenges & Fixes
